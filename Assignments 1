Task 1:
2)Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple
of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a
comma-separated sequence on a single line

for i in range(2000,3201):  
    if i%7 == 0 and i%5!=0:  #Should be Divisible by 7  and not divisible by 5
        print(i,end=',')
print("\b")

3) Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in
the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.

FirstName = input("Enter your First Name : ");
LastName = input("Enter your Last Name :  ");
print("Hi Hello " + LastName+" " + FirstName); #" " --> Space

4) Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm

pi = 3.142;
r = float(12/2); #radius = Diameter/2
Volume = 4/3 * pi * r ** 3;
print(" The volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm :", Volume);

Task â€“ 2:

1) Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list

List = input("Enter the comma sep numbers : ");
List = List.split(",");
print("The Generated list from the comma sep numbers are ", List);

2) Create the below pattern using nested for loop in Python

n = 5;
for i in range(n):        
    for j in range(i):         #star incrementing Loop
        print ('* ', end="")
    print('') 

for i in range(n,0,-1):        #Star decrementing Loop
    for j in range(i):
        print('* ', end="")
    print('')
    
3) Write a Python program to reverse a word after accepting the input from the user

Word = input("Enter a word to reverse: ")
for char in range(len(Word) - 1, -1, -1): #Reversing Loop 
  print(Word[char], end="")             
print(" is the reversed word of "+Word) #Reversed Word

4) Write a Python Program to print the given string in the format specified in the sample output.

print("WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA,\n\thaving solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN,! \n\t\tSOCIALIST, SECULAR, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC \n\t\t and to secure to all its citizens")
